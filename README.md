# Dev Logger

===========

## Installation

`yarn add dev-logger-simple` or `npm install dev-logger-simple`

## Usage

```
var devLogger = require('@kenshinman/dev-logger');

devLogger("this output", "that output")

//output
//arg 1 => "this output"
//arg 2 => "that output"
```

Simply way to make sure your `console.log` statements are only logged in `development` environment.

Takes single or multiple parameters and they are logged in order of appearance.

PS: My first NPM package too.

### Suggestions are welcome
